            <strong>
              1. What is the eligibility criteria to purchase a life insurance
              policy in India?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The eligibility depends on factors such as the minimum age
            (typically 18 years) and the maximum age, which varies based on the
            type of policy. Health conditions and other insurer-specific
            criteria may also apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              2. What are the exclusions in health insurance policies?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Common exclusions include pre-existing conditions (during the
            waiting period), cosmetic surgery, treatment for self-inflicted
            injuries, and injuries resulting from illegal activities or
            high-risk behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              3. What factors determine the premium amount for life and non-life
              insurance?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Premiums are based on factors such as age, health, policy type, sum
            assured, policy tenure, and additional riders. Non-life policies are
            also influenced by the value of the insured asset (e.g., vehicle or
            property).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> 4. Can I buy life insurance for someone else? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, you can buy life insurance for someone else if you have an
            insurable interest, such as for your spouse, children, or business
            partners. You must provide proof of this insurable interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              5. What happens if I miss the payment of a premium for non-life
              insurance?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the premium is missed, the policy may lapse. Some insurers offer
            a grace period (usually 15-30 days) for you to make the payment and
            restore the coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              6. Is there a grace period for paying premiums under a life
              insurance policy?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, life insurance policies usually have a grace period, typically
            30 days, after the premium due date. The policy remains in force
            during this period, but failure to pay within the grace period may
            lead to policy lapse.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              7. What is the waiting period in health insurance policies?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Health insurance policies typically have a waiting period of 2-4
            years for pre-existing diseases. Additionally, certain conditions,
            like maternity benefits, may have a waiting period.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              8. Can I change the coverage amount during the tenure of my life
              insurance policy?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some life insurance policies allow you to change the coverage amount
            during the policy term. This could involve paying additional
            premiums if the coverage amount increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              9. What documents are required to buy a health insurance policy in
              India?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Documents typically required include proof of identity (Aadhaar,
            PAN), proof of address, age proof, and sometimes a medical report,
            depending on the insurer’s policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> 10. Can I purchase multiple insurance policies? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, you can buy multiple life or non-life insurance policies.
            However, the total coverage should be reasonable and aligned with
            your actual insurance needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              11. What is the difference between term life insurance and whole
              life insurance?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (e.g.,
            20 years), while whole life insurance offers coverage for the entire
            life of the policyholder, with an added savings component.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> 12. What is the sum assured in life insurance? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The sum assured is the amount the insurer will pay to the
            beneficiaries upon the policyholder’s death, or to the policyholder
            upon maturity, depending on the type of policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >13. What is the waiting period for critical illness policies?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Critical illness policies generally have a waiting period of 90 days
            to 180 days, during which no claim for critical illness can be made.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              14. What are the different types of life insurance policies?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The main types of life insurance policies in India include term
            insurance, endowment plans, money-back policies, whole life
            policies, ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans), and pension plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              15. What is the role of riders in life insurance policies?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Riders are additional benefits added to a base life insurance
            policy. Common riders include critical illness, accidental death,
            and waiver of premium riders, which offer extra protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              16. How does a ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) work?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            ULIPs combine insurance and investment. A portion of the premium is
            used for life cover, while the rest is invested in various
            market-linked funds, offering returns based on market performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> 17. What is the benefit of a money-back policy? </strong>

            <strong> 19. What does a vehicle insurance policy cover? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Vehicle insurance policies provide coverage for damages to the

            <strong> 20. How does a pension policy work? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A pension policy helps in building a corpus for retirement. The
            policyholder contributes premiums during the accumulation phase, and
            after retirement, the insurer pays out regular income in the form of
            annuities.

          </p>
          <p>
            An endowment policy is a life insurance product that combines
            protection and savings. It provides a lump sum payout at the end of
            the policy term or on the policyholder’s death.

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            To file a claim, you need to notify the insurer, submit necessary
            documents (medical bills, hospital records), and follow the claim
            process outlined by the insurer. Cashless claims may be available at
            network hospitals.

            <strong> 23. What is third-party vehicle insurance? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Third-party vehicle insurance provides coverage for damages caused
            to third parties (people or property) in the event of an accident.
            It is mandatory in India under the Motor Vehicles Act.

              Authority of India (IRDAI)?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The IRDAI is the regulatory body overseeing the insurance industry
            in India. It ensures that insurers follow standard practices,

              25. How are claims settled in life insurance policies?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Claims are settled based on the policy terms. After the death of the
            policyholder or the policy’s maturity, the nominee or the
            policyholder (in case of endowment or money-back policies) submits a
            claim, along with required documents.

              insurance?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Life insurance provides coverage for life-related risks, while
            general insurance (non-life insurance) covers a range of risks such
            as health, vehicle, property, and travel insurance.
